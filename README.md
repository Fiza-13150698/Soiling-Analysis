# Soiling-Analysis
A data-driven study analyzing the effect of dust and debris accumulation on photovoltaic (PV) module performance. Includes experimental design, I‑V curve analytics, and performance degradation modeling conducted during my internship at Helmholtz Institute Erlangen.

#  PV Soiling Impact Analysis

**Hands-on experiment assessing dust & debris accumulation effects on photovoltaic (PV) module performance.**  
*Quantified power output degradation due to soiling across multiple test cycles (shadowing effect).*

##  Project Overview
This project investigates the **impact of soiling on photovoltaic (PV) module efficiency** through controlled experiments performed during my research internship at the **Helmholtz Institute Erlangen (Aug–Nov 2023)**.  
The goal was to measure how dust and other accumulations affect the output of PV systems through shadowing and to model performance degradation trends over time.

**Objective:** Develop experimental insights and quantitative analysis methods for assessing environmental soiling effects on solar modules.

##  My Contributions
- help design and assembled a custom **soiling test rig** for exposure experiments.  
- Conducted **multi-cycle I‑V curve tests** to measure efficiency changes.  
- Used **Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)** for data cleaning and visualization.  
- Created **Excel-based dashboards** summarizing power loss patterns.  
- Developed a **protocol for reproducible PV soiling assessment** for future research.

## Experimentation
- materials of different level of transparency (0%, 80% and 90%)  was placed on a solar module as a function of cell area. ( i.e, 1%,5%,10%.....,100%). 
- illuminated under 1000W/sq.m
- I-V curve measurement was done
- Power drop as a function of area of cell covered was  analyzed using python scirpt and microsoft excel.
